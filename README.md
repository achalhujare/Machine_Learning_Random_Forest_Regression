Random Forest Regression in Machine Learning Algorithm:

ðŸ“˜ Overview:

This Jupyter Notebook walks through the practical application of the Random Forest Regression algorithm using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library. It demonstrates each step in a beginner-friendly manner and includes the following key components:

ðŸ§© Sections Included:

1. Library Imports:
Core Python libraries like numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn are imported to handle data operations, model building, and visualization.
2. Data Preparation:
The dataset is loadedâ€”often using pandas or NumPyâ€”and split into input features (X) and the output/target variable (y).
3. Model Building:
An instance of RandomForestRegressor is created and trained on the processed dataset.
4. Making Predictions:
The trained model is used to generate predictions on given input values.
5. Plotting Results:
A high-resolution graph is plotted to display the modelâ€™s predictions, helping visualize the fit and how Random Forest captures complex data patterns.

âœ… Highlights:

A clean, easy-to-follow implementation ideal for beginners.
Demonstrates how ensemble methods like Random Forest boost performance using multiple decision trees.
Offers a visual representation of the model's ability to map non-linear relationships.
